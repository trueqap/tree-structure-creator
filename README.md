# Tree Structure Creator

This Python script creates a directory structure based on the output of the Linux `tree` command. It reads a text file containing the tree structure and recreates the directories and files accordingly.

## Features

- Parses the output of the Linux `tree` command
- Creates directories and files based on the parsed structure
- Handles nested directories of any depth
- Supports both files and directories
- Does not overwrite existing files or directories

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Save the output of the Linux `tree` command to a file named `tree.txt`.
2. Place the `tree.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script:

```
python tree.py
```

The script will create the directory structure based on the contents of `tree.txt`.

## Input Format

The input file (`tree.txt`) should contain the output of the Linux `tree` command. Here's an example of a React Weather App structure:

```
weather-app/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── manifest.json
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── WeatherDisplay.js
│   │   ├── SearchBar.js
│   │   ├── ForecastCard.js
│   │   └── LoadingSpinner.js
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── weatherApi.js
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── useWeatherData.js
│   ├── utils/
│   │   └── dateFormatter.js
│   ├── styles/
│   │   ├── index.css
│   │   └── WeatherDisplay.module.css
│   ├── App.js
│   └── index.js
├── .env
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

## How It Works

1. The script reads the `tree.txt` file line by line.
2. It determines the depth of each item based on the tree structure characters (│, └, ├).
3. It extracts the name of each file or directory.
4. It creates directories and empty files according to the parsed structure.
5. If a file or directory already exists at the specified location, the script will not overwrite or modify it.

## Limitations

- The script assumes that the `tree.txt` file is correctly formatted and follows the standard Linux `tree` command output format.
- It creates empty files for all file entries in the tree structure that don't already exist.
- The script does not delete any existing files or directories that are not present in the tree structure.
